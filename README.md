# Arkanoid Game 
Arkanoid is a simple arcade game that you can play on your computer. The game involves breaking blocks on the board using a ball.
The main goal is to score as many points as possible. It's a straightforward project that we created together.
We wrote the entire code using the C++ language in the Clion program, utilizing an object-oriented structure.
We created all the graphics used in the project ourselves, and the whole game is displayed as a pop-up window created with the SFML library.

## How to play 
Upon opening the game, we see a simple main menu where we can navigate options using the arrow keys and the "enter" key. To read the instructions, we need to select the "instruction" option.
Once we choose the "play" option, the game starts. We control the paddle using the arrow keys. If the ball hits a purple block, the player earns one point, and the block is removed.
If the ball hits a turquoise block, the player earns 50 points, and the block explodes, destroying all surrounding blocks. The player can also pause the game by pressing the "P" key, and to resume the game, they need to press the "P" key again on the keyboard.
The game ends when the ball falls below the paddle. At that point, the player's score is displayed on the screen, along with a menu of options where we navigate similarly to the main menu.
